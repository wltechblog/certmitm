## Current Status
The tool is fully functional and has been successfully used to discover numerous vulnerabilities in major applications and systems. It was presented at DEF CON 31 in August 2023 and continues to be maintained and improved.

## Known Issues
- The tool requires specific network configuration which may be complex for some users
- Real certificates are needed for comprehensive testing but not included in the repository
- Some edge cases in TLS implementations may cause unexpected behavior
- Limited documentation for advanced usage scenarios
