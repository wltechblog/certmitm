# certmitm Active Context

## Current Status
The certmitm tool is a fully functional security testing application for identifying TLS certificate validation vulnerabilities. It has been successfully used to discover and report numerous vulnerabilities in major applications and systems.

## Recent Changes
- Improved certificate handling with better error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Fixed client retry loop issue by improving error handling and data validation
- Improved certificate retrieval with better timeout handling
- Enhanced socket error handling to prevent bad responses
- Added robust handling of missing real certificates
- The tool was presented at DEF CON 31 in August 2023
- Documentation has been updated with usage examples and discovered vulnerabilities
- The Hall of Fame section tracks publicly disclosed vulnerabilities found with the tool

## Current Focus
- Maintaining compatibility with modern TLS implementations
- Supporting additional certificate testing techniques
- Improving logging and reporting capabilities
- Expanding the documentation with real-world examples
- Enhancing error handling and reliability
- Adding proper timeouts to prevent hanging connections
- Ensuring robust handling of network errors and edge cases

## Active Decisions

### Testing Methodology
The tool currently implements four main testing approaches:
1. **Self-signed certificates**: Tests if clients accept certificates signed by themselves
2. **Replaced key certificates**: Tests if clients verify the certificate's public key
3. **Real certificates**: Tests if clients accept valid certificates for different domains
4. **Real certificates as CA**: Tests if clients accept certificates signed by valid but unauthorized CAs

These approaches cover the most common certificate validation vulnerabilities while keeping the testing process efficient.

### Network Configuration
The tool requires specific network configuration to intercept connections:
- It acts as a network gateway for client devices
- It uses iptables to redirect HTTPS traffic
- It provides DHCP/DNS services for connected clients

This approach allows for comprehensive testing of various client devices and applications without requiring modifications to the clients themselves.

### Logging and Reporting
The current logging system provides:
- Real-time console output for immediate feedback
- Detailed logs of intercepted data for analysis
- Structured storage of test results for reporting

This balanced approach provides both immediate feedback during testing and comprehensive data for later analysis.

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
- Add support for additional certificate validation tests
- Improve error handling for edge cases
- Enhance documentation with more examples
- Add support for upstream proxies

### Medium-term Goals
- Develop a web interface for easier result analysis
- Add support for automated testing of specific applications
- Implement pre-generation of certificates for faster testing
- Create reporting templates for vulnerability disclosure

### Long-term Vision
- Expand to support additional protocols beyond HTTPS
- Develop plugins for popular security testing frameworks
- Create a database of known vulnerable applications
- Provide automated remediation recommendations
