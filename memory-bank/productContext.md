# certmitm Product Context

## Problem Statement
Many applications and devices fail to properly validate TLS certificates, creating security vulnerabilities that can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. These vulnerabilities are often difficult to detect without specialized tools.

## Solution
certmitm provides a comprehensive testing framework that:
1. Intercepts TLS connections
2. Tests multiple certificate validation bypass techniques
3. Automatically identifies vulnerable connections
4. Logs intercepted data for analysis

## Target Users
- Security researchers
- Penetration testers
- Application developers
- Device manufacturers
- Security auditors

## User Experience Goals
- Simple command-line interface
- Clear reporting of vulnerable connections
- Minimal setup requirements
- Detailed logging for analysis
- Support for various testing scenarios

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Testing Client Applications
1. User sets up certmitm as a network gateway
2. Client devices connect through the gateway
3. Applications on client devices make HTTPS connections
4. certmitm tests various certificate validation techniques
5. Vulnerable connections are identified and logged
6. User analyzes results to determine security issues

### Secondary Use Case: Security Research
1. Researcher identifies target applications or devices
2. Sets up certmitm with appropriate test certificates
3. Conducts systematic testing of certificate validation
4. Documents vulnerabilities for responsible disclosure
5. Verifies fixes after vendor remediation

## Value Proposition
certmitm enables users to:
- Quickly identify certificate validation vulnerabilities
- Test multiple attack vectors automatically
- Document vulnerabilities with concrete evidence
- Verify security fixes
- Improve overall security posture

## Success Stories
The tool has already been used to identify and responsibly disclose numerous vulnerabilities in major products, including:
- Microsoft Azure SDKs
- Apple iOS App Store
- Microsoft Windows components
- Samsung Email for Android
